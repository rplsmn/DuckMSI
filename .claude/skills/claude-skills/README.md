Claude agent skills for using R's tidyverse. Mostly Derived from [Sarah Johnson's stellar CLAUDE.md](https://gist.github.com/sj-io/3828d64d0969f2a0f05297e59e6c15ad), though I am also adding my personal skills here, too.

Claude consumes a CLAUDE.md entirely all at once. If you don't want to use that many tokens in each Claude session, [agent skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) are an alternative. Claude reads agent skills progressively as needed, avoiding the consumption of tokens when not needed.
